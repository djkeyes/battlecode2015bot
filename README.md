This is a clone of the original git repository for djkeyes's submission to Battlecode 2015, as team #379 Bangla Rush. I'm making it publicly available since the contest is over now.

The code here wasn't really designed with readability in mind, but you can skim it if you would like. The final submission was of the dronerush package.
